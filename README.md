## Analytical Questions and Visual Insights

### **Question 1:**  
**How does the age of offenders (under 18 vs. over 18) vary across different types of hate crime biases?**

**Importance:**  
This chart compares offender age groups across bias types. While most hate crimes are committed by adults, some categoriesâ€”like *Anti-Black* and *Anti-Gay (Male)*â€”show notable youth involvement.

**Use Case:**  
This insight supports targeted early-intervention and educational outreach, especially in schools and youth-focused programs.

### **Question 2:**  
**During which years did hate crimes involving specific biases (e.g., Anti-Black, Anti-Gay, Anti-Jewish) peak, and what trends emerge over time?**

**Note:**
We showed both pre and post filtering for biases with consistent trends versus those which had very little frequency and therefore were unable to show trends over time.

**Importance:**  
These graphs reveal temporal spikes in specific types of hate crimes. Notably, *Anti-Black* and *Anti-Jewish* incidents saw surges in certain years, often aligning with social or political events.

**Use Case:**  
Understanding these patterns enables better resource planning and helps advocacy groups or city officials respond proactively to emerging bias-related threats.
